# 2.1 Basic Memory Partition

## 2.1.1 Architecture

First, let's review the state of the memory in a real Von Neumann System.

The memory is divided into several parts: Stack, Un-mapped MM, Heap, BSS, Data, Text.

## 2.1.2 Basic Features

* Stack: Records temporary data. For example, local variables, activity records of recursive functions, intermediate results of complex calculations. **The memory area automatically allocated by the operating system.**

* Unmapped part: Between the stack and the heap, has not been used at current moment.

* Heap: **The memory area that the programmer actively applied for.** In C++, we could use `malloc`, `new`, `free`, `delete` to operate this part.

* BSS(Block Started by Symbol) : Record uninitialized data. It is just declared in the program without a initialized value. So it doesn't take memory space. e.g.: `int a;` in C++.

* Data: Records initialized data. Initialized data occupies memory space. When an executable file need to be run, the data in BSS must to loaded into the memory. e.g.: `int a = 10;` in C++.

* Text: Records the execution code. The size of this memory area is determined before it runs.
